## ✨ Features

This portfolio is more than just a static page. Here are some of the key features I implemented:

*   🎨 **Sleek Dark-Mode Design:** A modern, professional look that's easy on the eyes.
*   📱 **Fully Responsive:** Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   🗂️ **Tabbed Navigation:** Smoothly switch between Profile, Education, Skills, and other sections without reloading the page.
*   🖱️ **Interactive Skill Cards:** Hover and click on skills to get more details.
*   🚀 **On-Scroll Animations:** Elements elegantly fade into view as you scroll, thanks to the Intersection Observer API.
*   📄 **Expandable Project Details:** Keep the main view clean by hiding project details behind a "View Details" toggle.
*   📥 **One-Click CV Download:** A prominent button that allows recruiters to easily download a PDF version of my CV.
*   ✍️ **Typewriter Effect:** An animated typing effect on the main header for a nice visual touch.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Want to explore the code on your own machine? It's simple:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Manula-Fernando/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    You can simply open `index.html` in your web browser. For the best experience (especially if you plan to make changes), I recommend using a live server. If you use VS Code, the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension is a great choice.
